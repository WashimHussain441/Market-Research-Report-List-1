<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arachnoid Cysts Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Drainage System Surgery</li><li>Endoscopic Cyst Fenestration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Arachnoid Cysts Treatment Market includes two primary surgical interventions: Permanent Drainage System Surgery and Endoscopic Cyst Fenestration. Permanent Drainage System Surgery involves the placement of a shunt to continuously drain cerebrospinal fluid, alleviating pressure and symptoms. In contrast, Endoscopic Cyst Fenestration entails creating openings in the cyst walls to allow fluid drainage without the need for long-term shunting. Both methods aim to relieve symptoms associated with arachnoid cysts, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></p>
