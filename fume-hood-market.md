<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fume Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fume hood market comprises two primary types: ductless and ducted fume hoods. Ductless fume hoods operate by filtering air through activated carbon or HEPA filters, recirculating cleaned air back into the laboratory, making them suitable for spaces lacking ventilation infrastructure. In contrast, ducted fume hoods are connected to a building's ventilation system, expelling hazardous fumes outside, thus providing a higher level of safety for handling volatile substances. Each type serves distinct applications based on safety and space requirements.</p></p>
