<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Ventilators for Critical Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical ventilators for critical care are categorized into two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require an artificial airway, such as an endotracheal tube, providing direct access to the lungs for patients with severe respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver respiratory support through a mask or nasal interface, avoiding the need for intubation. Both types play a crucial role in managing patients with respiratory distress, enhancing oxygen delivery, and facilitating carbon dioxide removal in critical care settings.</p></p>
