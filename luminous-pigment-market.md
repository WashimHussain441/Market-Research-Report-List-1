<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The luminous Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Luminous Coatings</li><li>Fluorescent Coatings</li><li>Phosphorescent Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The luminous pigment market comprises three main types: self-luminous coatings, fluorescent coatings, and phosphorescent coatings. Self-luminous coatings emit light independently, often using radioisotopes, making them suitable for applications like watches and emergency signs. Fluorescent coatings absorb light and re-emit it almost instantaneously, enhancing visibility under UV light, ideal for safety gear. Phosphorescent coatings, on the other hand, store absorbed light and release it gradually, providing a glow-in-the-dark effect, commonly used in toys and emergency exit signs.</p></p>
