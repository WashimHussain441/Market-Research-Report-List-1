<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self expandable Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-expandable intracranial stents market consists of two main types: open-loop and closed-loop stents. Open-loop stents have a simple, uncoiled structure, allowing for flexibility and ease of placement in various anatomical conditions. Closed-loop stents, in contrast, feature a continuous, coiled design that provides enhanced support and stability once deployed. Both types are used in neurovascular interventions, addressing conditions like aneurysms and arterial stenosis, allowing for improved blood flow and vessel reinforcement in the cranial region.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Self expandable Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-expandable intracranial stents market primarily focuses on two significant applications: ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. In ischemic stroke, stents are utilized to restore blood flow by reopening blocked arteries, enhancing perfusion to affected brain areas. Conversely, in hemorrhagic stroke scenarios, they provide stability to weak or abnormally shaped blood vessels, preventing further bleeding. This dual functionality positions self-expandable stents as critical tools in neurovascular interventions, improving patient outcomes in various stroke types through minimally invasive procedures.</p></p>
