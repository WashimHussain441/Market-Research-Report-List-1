<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulosis Microfiltration Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross Flow</li><li>Direct Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cellulosis Microfiltration Membranes market is categorized into two main types: Cross Flow and Direct Flow. Cross Flow microfiltration utilizes a tangent flow direction, allowing permeate to pass through while maintaining a bulk flow of feed across the membrane surface. This design reduces fouling and enhances filtration efficiency. In contrast, Direct Flow microfiltration allows feed to flow directly toward the membrane, providing a simpler setup but tending to face higher fouling rates. Each type is chosen based on specific application needs and operational efficiencies.</p></p>
