<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HVAC damper actuators market is divided into two main types: spring return and non-spring return actuators. Spring return damper actuators utilize a spring mechanism that returns the damper to a pre-defined position when power is lost, ensuring safety and proper airflow. In contrast, non-spring return actuators rely solely on motor power to move the damper and maintain its position, providing precise control but requiring continuous power. Both types serve vital roles in optimizing HVAC system efficiency and performance.</p></p>
